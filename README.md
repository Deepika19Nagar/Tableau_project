Customer satisfaction is one of the important things to take business to 
new heights. Lynda, the customer relationship manager of an 
ecommerce company is accountable to ensure that the company is 
taking every initiative to meet the customer needs and expectations. She 
wants customers to have a long, faithful, and cost-effective journey with 
her organization. This involves providing best offers to their customers, 
creating attractive branding strategy, giving out of box solutions to the 
customer concerns, and maintaining complete customer fulfilment.
The manager wants to analyze the revenue generated by top N 
customers in each year. She also wants to see customer order frequency 
as her aim is to generate more robust information about customer 
purchasing behavior.
Additionally, the manager needs to understand customer acquisition and 
orders placed by them. She needs to examine the number of customers 
acquired in each region. Finally, she needs to analyze the performance of 
various regions, states, and cities.
This way the manager can take initiatives to improve customer 
conversion rates, increase customer retention, and maximize customer 
lifetime value.
